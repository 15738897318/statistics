## two problems:
## - the directory returned by 'mfilename' must not be added also
##   (endless loop)
## - 'genpath' of Octave 4.0 includes directories indiscriminately,
##    e.g. 'private' directories
addpath (fullfile (fileparts (mfilename ("fullpath")),
                   {"base", "distributions", "models", "tests"}){:})
